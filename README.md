# App goal

Our Vue application uses the [MTG API](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/) to display Magic The Gathering cards and decks.

Our app allows users to search and see Magic cards and build decks with them.

# Workflow

When developing the project, some rules are to be followed **strictly**.

## Master branch

**Never** commit against the `master` branch.

The master branch should only see merges from development branches.

## Dev branches

When developing something, it **must** have its **own** development branch.

Development branches names **must** look like `dev_<functionality-name>`, where :
- the prefix `dev_` never changes
- `<functionality-name>` is the name of the functionnality where words are separated by `-`

As such, when you start coding something, create a `dev_somethin-you-code` branch. Then code and commit against it. Finally, when the thing is ready for production, merge your branch in `master`.

## Ticketting

Every commit **must** be linked to a ticket.

The Trello is [here](https://trello.com/b/SypsBzSt) ; ideally, every ticket should have a commit and vice-versa.

## Testing

**Never** commit without testing, even for a comment.

Always check if the project compiles and if the main functions plus what you just did works at least as well as it did before.

## Fix branches

When fixing a big problem, a branch **must** be created.

Although the previous rule should offer protection against big bugs, shit happens. Would a big problem arise after merging into master, a fix branch should be created. 

It should be named as `fix_<broken-thing>`.

# Recommandations

While not being mandatory, those practices should be followed during the development process.

## Commits

Try to include meaningful commit descriptions, for exemple by using the following keywords to start your descriptions.

| Keyword  |              Meaning              |                     Exemple                      |
| :------: | :-------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------: |
|   Add    |      Create a functionality       |      `Added chocolate to the cake project`       |
|  Remove  |      Remove a functionality       |       `Removed salt from the cake project`       |
|   Fix    |           Fix an issue            | `Fixed chocolate pureness percentage (99 to 75)` |
|   Bump   | Increase the version of something |       `Bumped cacao version (0.1 to 1.2)`        |
| Refactor |            Code change            |             `Refactored cake baking`             |
| Reformat |      Refactor of formatting       |        `Reformated Knife.Vue indentation`        |
| Optimize |      Refactor of performance      |             `Optimized cake serving`             |
| Document |     Refactor of documentation     |         `Documented cake baking process`         |

Although you should probably change one thing per commit, if you want to describe several changes in the same commit, break the changes in lines :

```
Added cake baking process
Documented cake baking process
Refactored cake serving component to use new cake baking process
```

Those lines should be relatively short (~100 characters, max).

## Git commands

Here is a handful of useful git commands :

|            Command             |                          Effect                          |
| :----------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
|        `git add <file>`        |           Stages a file in the pending commit            |
|          `git commit`          |                Commits every staged file                 |
|           `git push`           |      Sends local commits against the current branch      |
|           `git pull`           |              Gets every remote commits made              |
|    `git checkout <branch>`     |            Changes current branch to `branch`            |
| `git checkout -b <new-branch>` |      Creates new branch `branch` and switches to it      |
|      `git merge <branch>`      |         Merges `branch` into the current branch          |
|          `git status`          |         Shows the state of the local repository          |
|     `git clone <git-url>`      |    Clones the repository located at `git-url` locally    |
|       `git reset --hard`       |       Resets your local repository to last commit        |
|       `git diff [file]`        | Displays changes between current version and last commit |

To change a file, the «standard» workflow would be :
1. `git pull`
1. `git add folder/my-changed.file`
1. `git commit`
1. `git push`

The standard workflow for a branch would be :
1. `git pull`
1. `git checkout -b my-new-branch`
1. *do stuff and commit it*
1. `git checkout master`
1. `git merge my-new-branch`
1. `git push`

## Git aliases

If you want aliases to spend less time typing in your console and more in your IDE, here is a list of aliases :

| Alias |       Original command        |
| :---: | :---------------------------: |
| `Gal` | `git add --all && git status` |
| `Gad` |           `git add`           |
| `Gco` |         `git commit`          |
| `Gps` |          `git push`           |
| `Gpl` |          `git pull`           |
| `Gck` |        `git checkout`         |
| `Gbr` |       `git checkout -b`       |
| `Gst` |         `git status`          |
| `Grs` |      `git reset --hard`       |
| `Gmr` |          `git merge`          |
| `Gac` | `git add --all && git commit` |
| `Gff` |          `git diff`           |

The file is located in `fronty/tools/git_aliases` ; to add it in your bash, use the following command at the root of the project :

```bash
cp ./tools/git_aliases ~/.git_aliases && echo "[ -f ~/.git_aliases ] && . ~/.git_aliases" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

All set ! Test it by using `Gst`, for instance.
